  abstract = "Focal cortical dysplasia is a congenital abnormality of cortical
              development and the leading cause of surgically remediable
              drug-resistant epilepsy in children. Post-surgical outcome is
              improved by presurgical lesion detection on structural MRI.
              Automated computational techniques have improved detection of
              focal cortical dysplasias in adults but have not yet been
              effective when applied to developing brains. There is therefore a
              need to develop reliable and sensitive methods to address the
              particular challenges of a paediatric cohort. We developed a
              classifier using surface-based features to identify focal
              abnormalities of cortical development in a paediatric cohort. In
              addition to established measures, such as cortical thickness,
              grey-white matter blurring, FLAIR signal intensity, sulcal depth
              and curvature, our novel features included complementary metrics
              of surface morphology such as local cortical deformation as well
              as post-processing methods such as the ``doughnut'' method -
              which quantifies local variability in cortical morphometry/MRI
              signal intensity, and per-vertex interhemispheric asymmetry. A
              neural network classifier was trained using data from 22 patients
              with focal epilepsy (mean age = 12.1 $\pm$ 3.9, 9 females), after
              intra- and inter-subject normalisation using a population of 28
              healthy controls (mean age = 14.6 $\pm$ 3.1, 11 females).
              Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to quantify classifier
              sensitivity using established features and the combination of
              established and novel features. Focal cortical dysplasias in our
              paediatric cohort were correctly identified with a higher
              sensitivity (73\%) when novel features, based on our approach for
              detecting local cortical changes, were included, when compared to
              the sensitivity using only established features (59\%). These
              methods may be applicable to aiding identification of subtle
              lesions in medication-resistant paediatric epilepsy as well as to
              the structural analysis of both healthy and abnormal cortical
              development.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology
              associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always
              visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical
              delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an
              open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the
              presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.
              METHODS: We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154
              HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was
              used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes
              of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized
              pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative
              growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries.
              Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression
              classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was
              validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients
              with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls. RESULTS: HS was
              characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification
              alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier
              detected 90.1\% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions
              in 97.4\%. In patients with MRI-negative
              histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2\%
              (19/24) and lateralized 91.7\% (22/24). The model achieved similar
              performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability
              to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports
              contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to
              normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and
              report classifier predictions. INTERPRETATION: Automated and
              Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an
              open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and
              outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2024.",

               drug-resistant focal epilepsy, which can be cured by surgery.
               These lesions are extremely subtle and often missed even by
               expert neuroradiologists. ``Ground truth'' manual lesion masks
               are therefore expensive, limited and have large inter-rater
               variability. Existing FCD detection methods are limited by high
               numbers of false positive predictions, primarily due to vertex-
               or patch-based approaches that lack whole-brain context. Here,
               we propose to approach the problem as semantic segmentation
               using graph convolutional networks (GCN), which allows our model
               to learn spatial relationships between brain regions. To address
               the specific challenges of FCD identification, our proposed
               model includes an auxiliary loss to predict distance from the
               lesion to reduce false positives and a weak supervision
               classification loss to facilitate learning from uncertain lesion
               masks. On a multi-centre dataset of 1015 participants with
               surface-based features and manual lesion masks from structural
               MRI data, the proposed GCN achieved an AUC of 0.74, a
               significant improvement against a previously used vertex-wise
               multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier (AUC 0.64). With
               sensitivity thresholded at 67\%, the GCN had a specificity of
               71\% in comparison to 49\% when using the MLP. This improvement
               in specificity is vital for clinical integration of
               lesion-detection tools into the radiological workflow, through
               increasing clinical confidence in the use of AI radiological
               adjuncts and reducing the number of areas requiring expert

               organization are challenged by reliance on incompatible
               measurement methods at different spatial scales. Macroscale
               features such as cortical folding and functional activation are
               accessed through spatially dense neuroimaging maps, whereas
               microscale cellular and molecular features are typically measured
               with sparse postmortem sampling. Here, we integrate these
               distinct windows on brain organization by building upon existing
               postmortem data to impute, validate, and analyze a library of
               spatially dense neuroimaging-like maps of human cortical gene
               expression. These maps allow spatially unbiased discovery of
               cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually
               rapid transcriptional change which index distinct microstructure
               and predict neuroimaging measures of cortical folding and
               functional activation. Modules of spatially coexpressed genes

               diverse spatial scales and temporal epochs of human brain
               organization–ranging from protein–protein interactions to
               large-scale systems for cognitive processing. These module maps

              application is the identification of subtle epileptogenic focal
              cortical dysplasias (FCDs) from structural MRI. FCDs are
              difficult to visualize on structural MRI but are often amenable

              a retrospective MRI cohort of 1015 participants, 618 patients
              with focal FCD-related epilepsy and 397 controls, from 22
              epilepsy centres worldwide. We created a neural network for FCD
              detection based on 33 surface-based features. The network was

              tested on the remaining 50\% as well as on 2 independent test

              saliencies were used to interrogate network performance. Our

               improve our ability to predict post-operative seizure outcome
               using clinical features. We also conducted the first substantial
               external validation of a machine learning model trained to
               predict post-operative seizure outcome. METHODS: We performed a
               retrospective cohort study of 797 children who had undergone
               resective or disconnective epilepsy surgery at a tertiary
               center. We extracted patient information from medical records
               and trained three models - a logistic regression, a multilayer
               perceptron, and an XGBoost model - to predict one-year
               post-operative seizure outcome on our dataset. We evaluated the
               performance of a recently published XGBoost model on the same

               model performance, using learning curve analysis to estimate
               performance at samples up to N=2,000. Finally, we examined the
               impact of predictor selection on model performance. RESULTS: Our
               logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 72\% (95\%
               CI=68-75\%,AUC=0.72), while our multilayer perceptron and
               XGBoost both achieved accuracies of 71\% (95\% CIMLP

               own =0.70). There was no significant difference in performance
               between our three models (all P>0.4) and they all performed
               better than the external XGBoost, which achieved an accuracy of
               63\% (95\% CI=59-67\%,AUC=0.62; PLR =0.005,PMLP =0.01,PXGBoost
               own =0.01) on our data. All models showed improved performance
               with increasing sample size, but limited improvements beyond our
               current sample. The best model performance was achieved with
               data-driven feature selection. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that
               neither the deployment of complex machine learning models nor
               the assembly of thousands of patients alone is likely to
               generate significant improvements in our ability to predict
               post-operative seizure freedom. We instead propose that improved
               feature selection alongside collaboration, data standardization,
               and model sharing is required to advance the field.",

  abstract = "Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made
              famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for
              understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship
              with functional organization in the brain. However, these
              existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually
              annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured
              from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain
              quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It
              was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at
              20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a
              convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the
              cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many
              of the historical challenges with measurement of histological
              thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an
              unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this
              BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported
              thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor
              processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of
              cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to
              these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory
              processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and
              VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite
              pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness
              from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings
              illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between
              single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering,
              macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional
              neuroanatomy.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is often caused by
               focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). The distribution of these
               lesions across the cerebral cortex and the impact of lesion
               location on clinical presentation and surgical outcome are
               largely unknown. We created a neuroimaging cohort of patients
               with individually mapped FCDs to determine factors associated
               with lesion location and predictors of postsurgical outcome.
               METHODS: The MELD (Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection)
               project collated a retrospective cohort of 580 patients with
               epilepsy attributed to FCD from 20 epilepsy centers worldwide.
               Magnetic resonance imaging-based maps of individual FCDs with
               accompanying demographic, clinical, and surgical information
               were collected. We mapped the distribution of FCDs, examined for
               associations between clinical factors and lesion location, and
               developed a predictive model of postsurgical seizure freedom.
               RESULTS: FCDs were nonuniformly distributed, concentrating in
               the superior frontal sulcus, frontal pole, and temporal pole.
               Epilepsy onset was typically before the age of 10 years. Earlier
               epilepsy onset was associated with lesions in primary sensory
               areas, whereas later epilepsy onset was associated with lesions
               in association cortices. Lesions in temporal and occipital lobes
               tended to be larger than frontal lobe lesions. Seizure freedom
               rates varied with FCD location, from around 30\% in visual,
               motor, and premotor areas to 75\% in superior temporal and
               frontal gyri. The predictive model of postsurgical seizure
               freedom had a positive predictive value of 70\% and negative
               predictive value of 61\%. SIGNIFICANCE: FCD location is an
               important determinant of its size, the age at epilepsy onset,
               and the likelihood of seizure freedom postsurgery. Our atlas of
               lesion locations can be used to guide the radiological search
               for subtle lesions in individual patients. Our atlas of regional
               seizure freedom rates and associated predictive model can be
               used to estimate individual likelihoods of postsurgical seizure
               freedom. Data-driven atlases and predictive models are essential
               for evidence-based, precision medicine and risk counseling in
               epilepsy.",

  abstract = "ImportanceA leading cause of surgically remediable, drug-resistant
              focal epilepsy is focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). FCD is
              challenging to visualize and often considered magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI) negative. Existing automated methods for FCD
              detection are limited by high numbers of false-positive
              predictions, hampering their clinical utility.ObjectiveTo evaluate
              the efficacy and interpretability of graph neural networks in
              automatically detecting FCD lesions on MRI scans.Design, Setting,
              and ParticipantsIn this multicenter diagnostic study,
              retrospective MRI data were collated from 23 epilepsy centers
              worldwide between 2018 and 2022, as part of the Multicenter
              Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) Project, and analyzed in 2023.
              Data from 20 centers were split equally into training and testing
              cohorts, with data from 3 centers withheld for site-independent
              testing. A graph neural network (MELD Graph) was trained to
              identify FCD on surface-based features. Network performance was
              compared with an existing algorithm. Feature analysis, saliencies,
              and confidence scores were used to interpret network predictions.
              In total, 34 surface-based MRI features and manual lesion masks
              were collated from participants, 703 patients with FCD–related
              epilepsy and 482 controls, and 57 participants were excluded
              during MRI quality control.Main Outcomes and MeasuresSensitivity,
              specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of automatically
              identified lesions.ResultsIn the test dataset, the MELD Graph had
              a sensitivity of 81.6\% in histopathologically confirmed patients
              seizure-free 1 year after surgery and 63.7\% in MRI–negative
              patients with FCD. The PPV of putative lesions from the 260
              patients in the test dataset (125 female [48\%] and 135 male
              [52\%]; mean age, 18.0 [IQR, 11.0-29.0] years) was 67\% (70\%
              sensitivity; 60\% specificity), compared with 39\% (67\%
              sensitivity; 54\% specificity) using an existing baseline
              algorithm. In the independent test cohort (116 patients; 62 female
              [53\%] and 54 male [47\%]; mean age, 22.5 [IQR, 13.5-27.5] years),
              the PPV was 76\% (72\% sensitivity; 56\% specificity), compared
              with 46\% (77\% sensitivity; 47\% specificity) using the baseline
              algorithm. Interpretable reports characterize lesion location,
              size, confidence, and salient features.Conclusions and RelevanceIn
              this study, the MELD Graph represented a state-of-the-art, openly
              available, and interpretable tool for FCD detection on MRI scans
              with significant improvements in PPV. Its clinical implementation
              holds promise for early diagnosis and improved management of focal
              epilepsy, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.",
