Hello! I am Jack Highton and I joined the IMAGINE Lab as a postdoc in October 2024. 

I am working on creating a searchable multi-omic database for gene expression related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. I will also utilize this tool(s) to analyse transcriptomic signatures of risk genes, enhancing understanding of their role in these two neurodevelopmental disorders.

My background is in medical imaging, medical physics, data science, and machine learning.

I enjoy my gym, wikipedia, church, and cycling.
