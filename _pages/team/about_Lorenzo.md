Hi! I'm Lorenzo and I'm currently a PhD student at University of Florence collaborating with IMAGINE Lab.

My main focus is to develop object detection algorithm on MR-Images, with a particular focus on epilepsy pathology.

My background is in medical-physics and machine learning.

I'm always ready to play football or going for a run!
