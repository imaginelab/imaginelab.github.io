Hi, I’m Lennart. I’m a visiting PhD student from the [Translational Neuroimaging Lab](https://www.translationalneuroimaging.de/lennart-walger) in Bonn.

I have a background in robitics, specifically computer vision, and in my research I try to bridge the gap between computer science and medical application. In particular, I explore how we can develop and use AI in the diagnostic workup of people with focal eplipesy. During my time at Imagine Lab I am developing a heteromodal approach for lesion detection.

Outside of research I play rugby. Imagining opposing players as reviewer #2 has really helped me improving my tackling technique.
