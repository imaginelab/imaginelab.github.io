Hi! I am Lena. I am a postdoc in the IMAGINE lab. I previously worked on trajectories of functional and structural brain development in health and disease throughout the lifespan. 

In the lab, I will be working on linking genetic diagnosis, brain development and neurodevelopmental profiles in rare genetic cohorts. 

Outside the lab you can find me rock climbing, hiking, surfing, and enjoying veggie food.
