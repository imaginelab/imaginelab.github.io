Hi, I'm Mathilde! I'm a post-doc in the IMAGINE lab.

My work focuses on developing automated tools using AI to detect epilepsy lesions on MRI scans. 

My background is in physics, neuroimaging and machine-learning. 

When I'm not immersed in those amazing neuroscience projects, I enjoy leading scout activities, spending time in nature and playing squash.
