Hi, my name is Ali. I'm a MSc student at UCL working with the MELD team. My research focuses on MRI post-processing methods to detect cortical pathology associated with epilepsy. 

Currently, I'm intercalating as a fourth-year medical student at Barts and I'm highly interested in the fields of clinical epilepsy and machine learning.
